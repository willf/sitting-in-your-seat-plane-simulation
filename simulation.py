Thereâ€™s an airplane with 100 seats, and there are 100 ticketed passengers each
with an assigned seat. They line up to board in some random order. However, the
first person to board is the worst person alive, and just sits in a random
seat, without even looking at his boarding pass. Each subsequent passenger sits
in his or her own assigned seat if itâ€™s empty, but sits in a random open seat
if the assigned seat is occupied. What is the probability that you, the
hundredth passenger to board, finds your seat unoccupied?
